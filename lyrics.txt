DIE MONSTER. YOU DON'T BELONG IN THIS WORLD!

IT WAS NOT BY MY HAND I WAS ONCE AGAIN GIVEN FLESH. I WAS BROUGHT HERE BY HUMANS WHO WISHED TO BE ME TRIBUTE!

TRIBUTE!? YOU STEAL MEN'S SOULS, AND MAKE THEM YOUR SLAVES!

PERHAPS THE SAME COULD BE SAID OF ALL RELIGIONS…

YOUR WORDS ARE AS EMPTY AS YOUR SOUL! MANKIND ILL NEEDS A SAVIOR SUCH AS YOU!

WHAT IS A MAN? A MISERABLE LITTLE PILE OF SECRETS. BUT ENOUGH TALK… HAVE AT YOU!
